            <p class="text">
              Varroosis of honey bees is a commonly known and widespread
              disease. It also goes by other names such as varroatosis or Varroa
              mite infestation. Its main cause is the Varroa destructor or Acari
              Varroidae mite. This is a mite that targets the honey bee in all
              its life cycle stages, affecting many species of bees. It is
              believed to have originated from the Far East where its main host
              is the Asiatic honey bee. Earlier research suggests it was first
              introduced to the US in the 1950s. It has since spread to other
              countries globally, with the exception of Australia where no
              single case of the mite has been reported. The mite spread rapidly
              as a result of importation of queen bees from areas that are
              infested. Foraging bees can also introduce the mites to healthy
              colonies during pollination. Severe cases of varroa mite
              infestation can lead to colony collapse.

              chemical treatments. This can be justified since a lot of negative

              chemical solutions are only used when deemed necessary and should
              be used with caution. Local regulations as well as information
              provided on labels should be adhered to. It is a lack of knowledge

              Varroa mites are perhaps the most common pest devastating honey
              bee colonies within the US and beyond. The mite is a close
              relative to ticks common in livestock. This can explain why it is
              treated using similar products. Oxalic acid is particularly one of
              the products that have been tested and proven to work when it
              comes to the treatment of varroosis. It is an acaricide that is
              usually applied through three different techniques of treatment:
              spraying, trickling, and evaporation. It is generally effective in
              combating the varroa mites and is also tolerable to the honey
              bees. Oxalic Acid Pure Powder is a special formulation meant for
              the treatment of varroa mites. It helps in the elimination of
              other parasites found in the inter-frame space as well.
