          <p class="intro">
            Like every other animal or insect, honeybees are affected by pests
            and parasites. Perhaps the most common enemy of the honeybee is the
            varroa mite.

            <p class="text">
              Varroosis of honey bees is a commonly known and widespread
              disease. It also goes by other names such as varroatosis or Varroa
              mite infestation. Its main cause is the Varroa destructor or Acari
              Varroidae mite. This is a mite that targets the honey bee in all
              its life cycle stages, affecting many species of bees. It is
              believed to have originated from the Far East where its main host
              is the Asiatic honey bee. Earlier research suggests it was first
              introduced to the US in the 1950s. It has since spread to other
              countries globally, with the exception of Australia where no
              single case of the mite has been reported. The mite spread rapidly
              as a result of importation of queen bees from areas that are
              infested. Foraging bees can also introduce the mites to healthy
              colonies during pollination. Severe cases of varroa mite
              infestation can lead to colony collapse.

            <p class="text">
              The varroa mite is similar to the tick you might have seen in
              livestock. As a matter of fact, they are close relatives. This
              mite has been devastating bee colonies for decades since it was
              first reported within the USA in 1980s. There are so many products
              and techniques that can be used to minimize or even eliminate the
              varroa mites. The use of miticides and other treatments has been
              on the rise, even though some beekeepers are still skeptical about
              chemical treatments. This can be justified since a lot of negative
              information is out there. However, it is important to note that
              chemical solutions are only used when deemed necessary and should
              be used with caution. Local regulations as well as information
              provided on labels should be adhered to. It is a lack of knowledge
              that causes most users to brush off a remedy even before they
              fully comprehend all it entails. Taktic Amitraz offers a chemical
              solution to the invasive varroa mites. Its main ingredient is the
              widely used Amitraz that works as a systemic acaricide targeting
              parasitic mites such as varroa mites.

              Varroa mites are perhaps the most common pest devastating honey

              the products that have been tested and proven to work when it
              comes to the treatment of varroosis. It is an acaricide that is
              usually applied through three different techniques of treatment:
              spraying, trickling, and evaporation. It is generally effective in
              combating the varroa mites and is also tolerable to the honey
              bees. Oxalic Acid Pure Powder is a special formulation meant for
              the treatment of varroa mites. It helps in the elimination of
              other parasites found in the inter-frame space as well.

              One of the biggest impacts of varroa mite infestation is colony collapse that is fueled 
              by winter challenges such as food shortage, extremely low temperatures, and predisposition 
              to pests and diseases. If the mites are left uncontrolled, even strong bee colonies 
              can be wiped out in a matter of months. Varroa mites have ferocious appetite and enjoy 
              a shorter life cycle giving them an edge over the honey bee. The Bayvarol strips helps 
              in the diagnosis and treatment of varroa mites. It comprises Flumethrin as its active

              Some of the commonly used methods of dealing with varroa mites include: physical, mechanical, 
              chemical and behavioral. Chemical control measures are generally much more effective, given 
              the fact that they help to completely wipe out the invasive mites. One of the biggest challenges 
              when dealing with varroa mites, is the fact that their developmental stages are well protected 
              courtesy of the encrusted brood cells. This is where they develop rapidly and are able to evade 
              treatment. Amitraz Plus Strips offer a better way of dealing with varroa mites. The potent

              The tracheal mite, while not native to America, was first reported in Texas where, in 1984, a commercial apiary 
              operation tested positive for the mite. It has by now spread to all the beekeeping states in the USA despite a 
              huge effort to control the spread by destroying infected colonies. The parasite is spread easily among colonies 
              by drifting bees and through any activity where live bees are moved around colonies. Honey bees contaminated with 
              mites have been found in randomly selected swarms (colonies) and even in packaged bees and queens. This guide
