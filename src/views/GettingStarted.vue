          <h1>Getting started with apiculture</h1>

          <p class="intro">
            You might hear the term being thrown around all the time, but just what is beekeeping, and what does it entail? Let’s start from the bottom.

            Now beekeeping, or apiculture as it is also known, is the human activity of maintaining honey bees. A beekeeper, or apiarist (that will soon be you), 
            is someone who keeps honey bees for the purpose of collecting their honey and other products that are produced by the hive such as propolis, beeswax 
            and royal jelly, or to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. Beekeeping can be done using stinging or stingless bees.

              What Type of Agriculture is Beekeeping?

            <p class="text">
              Beekeeping is a type of agricultural production. It is called Apiculture in general. When stingless bees are used in beekeeping, 
              the agriculturally oriented name of beekeeping changes depending on the species of bee used. Apiculture is in reference to bees 
              of the Apis genus. The most commonly kept honey bee species are Apis Mellifera and Apis Cerana. Due to the complexity of biological 
              naming and the difficulty in recalling some of the names, it is generally right to call any form of beekeeping ‘apiculture’ when 
              speaking and writing about beekeeping. The art, science and practice of beekeeping encompass the life of honey bees and their 
              survival in man-made structures in quite a broad way.

              1. The Surroundings of the Beehive
            </h3>
            <p class="text">
              When you have decided to keep bees you will have to think about where you will keep them. The location where bees are kept 
              is called an apiary or bee yard. You will have to check with your local authority and find out about their regulations regarding 
              beekeeping, which varies from state to state and country to country.
              If you are planning to keep the bees in your backyard it will be better for you to do consultations with your family members and 
              your neighbors and make agreements with them, so as to avoid any possible quarrels.
              The next thing you’ll have to do is to choose the right type of hive in which to keep your bees.

              2. Types of Beehives
            </h3>

            <p class="text">
              <b>Langstroth Beehive</b><br>
              Named after its earlier designer Rev L.L. Langstroth, it has a history that spans over a century and a half. This type of beehive is 
              usually preferred by hobbyists and commercial beekeepers and very common in North America and New Zealand. Its advantages includes easy 
              maintenance, a simplified design with enough space available between brood chambers and supers, frames that are easily removable allowing 
              for easy bee inspection and division of bees; the beehives can also be re-used. The main disadvantage of this beehive is that during 
              inspection bees get disturbed a lot more than the other types of beehives.
              <br>
              <b>Top-bar Beehive</b><br>
              The top-bar beehive is usually widely used because of its ease of construction and affordability. With a top-bar beehive, bees do not get 
              easily disturbed during inspection, and it ensures high quality honey production by the bees. However, when compared to the two other types 
              of beehives mentioned above, the top-bar beehive allows bees to make more wax and less honey. Bees usually need to build new combs after every 
              inspection, and its open design exposes the combs to all weather conditions which may sometimes be too harsh to the bees.
              <br>
              <b>Warré Hive</b><br>
              The Warré hive is very easy to manage compared to the other hives, and is ideal for people who are busy and don’t have enough time to regularly 
              interact with the bees.
              <br>
              <b>British Standard National Beehive</b><br>
              The national beehive is usually very commonly found in the United Kingdom. Its advantages include its affordability and its ease of assembly; 
              it is also very efficient. However, most beekeepers who have used it have complained that its brood box is a little smaller than average. 
              To address the problem a different brood box can be used to operate it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="ArtTitle2">
              3. The Site Where you will Place your Beehive
            </h3>
            <p class="text">
              Usually the best location to place your beehive is a sunny place with a bit of shade, with a nearby water source like a pond. The hive should be 
              placed in such a way that it faces the south and should also have a fence in the north acting as a windbreak. A site near a field of flowers is 
              even more ideal as the bees will find it easy to collect nectar and easily get back to their hives.
              It would also be wise to find out about any possible bee predators and determine if the beehive can easily be accessed by such predators. 
              You wouldn’t want to invest your precious time and finances doing all the hard work then eventually lose your bee colony to predators.

              4. Other Important Things that you will Need
            </h3>
            <img
              class="image"

            />
            <p class="text">
              As mentioned earlier, people decide to venture into the business of beekeeping for various purposes but honey is usually the major basis for beekeeping. 
              As you know, bees get wild at the slightest provocation and can unleash harmful stings on humans, so they must be handled with great care and caution. 
              A beekeeper will therefore need some protection when going out to handle bees during routine inspection of the hive or during harvesting. As a beekeeper 
              you need to have purchase the beekeeper suit, the beekeeper gloves, the beekeeper hat and veil, the beekeeper jacket and the beekeeper boots. These are 
              the protective pieces of clothing that will help you avoid getting stung by the bees as you interact with them.
              For harvesting of honey, you will need to get the bee smoker and the honey extractor. The bee smoker helps to calm bees making them less aggressive as 
              you handle each of the frames on the hive. Once you have collected the combs rich in honey the next thing you will do is to get the honey and wax from 
              the combs without damaging them. This is where the honey extractor comes in handy. The honey extractor helps in the extraction of honey from bee combs 
              without damaging the combs or the wax. Honey extractors come in two major variants – the manual extractor and the electrical extractor. If you are a 
              beginner beekeeper you may start off with just a simple manual honey extractor as it is more affordable.
